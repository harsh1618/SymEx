Requirements to build 
LLVM-3.6
clang 
Z3 Solver
S3 Solver

Procedure to use 
-Place the Directory in llvm-src/lib/Transform
-make 
-../../../Release+Asserts/bin/opt -load ../../../Release+Asserts/lib/SymEx.so -symex -disable-output  < test.bc
#this generates files which have to be fed to S3 solver in Constraints Directory
#invoke S3 via 
./run.py -f a
This generates inputs sastisfying specified constraints. Verify the generated inputs for attack.

Generate the test.bc file via
-clang-3.6 -emit-llvm -c -g a.c -o test.bc
